What makes Solsniffer special?
------------------------------

Users who scan a token obtain a score out of 100, called the Snifscore. The snifscore is a score assigned to the token following an analysis of several factors. 

The Solsniffer tool scans and analyzes the token on several aspects such as:

- Mintable risk

- Freeze risk

- Top 20 distribution

- Owner's wallet

- LP prodiver count

Solsniffer has also set up a points system with a leaderboard which will be an airdrop. To promote their product, they are launching a Scan To Earn campaign with rewards for all users.

There are several ways to gain experience:

- Identify a problem in a contract: +20 XP

- Scan a contract that has never been scanned before: +100 XP

- Identify a fraudulent contract: +100 XP

- Invite a friend: +2000 XP
